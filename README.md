# README

This is our final project after Bitmaker's 9 week Immersive Web Dev Program. The original can be found at github.com/lor104.
It is also deployed on heroku at https://hoptimal.herokuapp.com. While I had some input on the Front-End the majority of my work was in building
the backend and business logic. I worked with the google maps API as well as getting location via the geo locator gem.

The Beverages, pictures, and info were compiled from the LCBO API.

The Bars where the beverages can be found are real however the drinks from those bars are fictitious.
